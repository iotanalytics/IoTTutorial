        "\n",
        "Spectral clustering is a way to cluster data that has a number of benefits and applications. It relies on the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix, which is a useful factorization theorem in matrix theory. It is a technique with roots in graph theory, where the approach is used to identify communities of nodes in a graph based on the edges connecting them. The method is flexible and allows us to cluster non graph data as well.\n",

        "\n",
        "Pros\n",
        "*   Clusters are not assumed to be any certain shape/distribution, in contrast to say k-means. This means the spectral clustering algorithm can perform well with a wide variety of shapes of data.\n",
        "*   Works quite well when relations are approximately transitive (like similarity)\n",
        "\n",
        "Cons\n",
        "*   Need to choose the number of clusters k, although there is a heuristic to help choose\n",
        "*   Can be costly to compute, although there are algorithms and frameworks to help\n",
        "*   For very large datasets computing eigenvectors is computationally expensive and becomes the bottleneck\n",
